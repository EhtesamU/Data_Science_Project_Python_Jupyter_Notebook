# “Is money the only determinant of happiness?”

## 1. Summary
Happiness has always been a determinant for one's life quality. There are various factors that can contribute to one’s happiness. While some believe that money is the only determinant for happiness, others hold the contrary opinion. This project gives us a clarification on whether money is the only factor deciding happiness or not.

## 2. Aim
Project goal: The goal of this project is to show whether money is the only determinant of happiness or not. To prove this, we show a clear analysis of different factors that contribute to the happiness of a country rather than just money. Factors such as GDP, health expectancy, social support, religious freedom may play a key role in the happiness index score of a country. The outcome of this project will show relationships between happiness and other mentioned factors. 

## 3. Dataset
The dataset came from Gallup World Poll, which was explored in a study by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and The Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. While the original study focused on the link between sustainable development and human well-being, our project will expand on the initial dataset and address the controversial discussion: “Is money the only determinant of happiness?”

The data revolves around the happiness evaluation of citizens from 156 countries in the world from 2015 - 2017. Accordingly, people are asked to rate their lives based on six metrics: GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to make Life Choices, Generosity, and Perception of Corruption.

The initial data will be combined with the Human Freedom Index 2019 dataset from Cato Institute and Emission dataset from Our World in Data – based at Oxford University - to examine whether affluent people are happy without freedom and healthy environments to reside. For the Human Freedom Index dataset, there are attributes relating to freedom of expression, religion, gender, and economic trading whereas variables of the Emission dataset underline the pollution rate in different countries. These additional elements aim to help clarify the original assumption regarding happiness dependency on pure money.

## 4. Analysis Techniques
In order to explore all relationships as mentioned above, the technique that we intent to use to analyse our datasets may include but not limited to
- Regression: using Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest Regression to analyse and predict the trend of happiness based on selected feature(s)
- Clustering: using K-means to find out all possibilities of existing categories within datasets based on our predetermined parameters.

Data visualisation is used to provide an accessible way to observe trend and pattern in the dataset.

## 5. Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Base - Retrieving and preparing data for our analysis and setting up management tools
- Retrieve data from:
  - Gallup World Poll by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and The Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University
  - The Human Freedom Index 2019 from Cato Institute and the Emission dataset from Our World in Data
- Management tools:
  - Project respiratory: Github.
  - Project management: Discord, Google Drive.

Tasks are expected to be completed by Week 8.

### Milestone 2: Data Processing - Merging and Cleansing 
Datasets are merged together to get the following variables:
- Data from Gallup World Poll: GDP per capita, social Support, healthy Life Expectancy, freedom to make Life Choices, generosity, perception of Corruption.
- Human Freedom Index 2019: Freedom of expression, religion, gender, economic trading.
- Emission dataset: pollution rate in different countries.

Tasks are expected to be completed by Week 10.

### Milestone 3: Data Analysis - Analysing the combined data to investigate the main topic
By week 12, our aim is to give the final yes/no answer to the question “Is money the only determinant of happiness?”. We will utilize techniques mentioned above to observe the patterns from the datasets. If the answer is no, what are the distinct variables that determine people happiness?

## 6. Relevant Prior Work
As mentioned above, Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and The Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University provided a report on the sustainability of happiness with other social factors while developing the economy. There are also many other researches that the main goal is directly related to money vs happiness. However, our work is to focus not only on money but also other factors that could potentially contribute to happiness.
